1. Scripts always run a new subshell.
   Script within script also runs within a new subshell of subshell.

2. The script file needs a execute permission in order to run.

3. bash can run a script withoout a exec permission because there a command exec   utes not the file.

4. Or to execute give the file's path or ./path

5. To give a execute permission we do : chmod u+x to give exec power to user. 
   Never user chmod +x for a file. It will  a security vurnebilty as every user will have the exec permission. So we only assign exec permission to the owner of the file and not to group or other users. 

6. shebang : At the start of the file we define a shebang like :
             #!/bin/bash for bash interpreter.
             #!/usr/bin/env python for python  

7. #mkdir "New Folder" and #mkdir New Folder 


8. /n for newline or /t for tab won't work untill echo -e

9.cd /etc/profile.d - List of open files for the bash shell
