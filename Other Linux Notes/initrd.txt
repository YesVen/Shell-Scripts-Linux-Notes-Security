#The initial RAM disk (initrd) is an initial root file system that is mounted prior to when the real root file system is
#available. The initrd is bound to the kernel and loaded as part of the kernel boot procedure. The kernel then mounts
#this initrd as part of the two-stage boot process to load the modules to make the real file systems available and get
#at the real root file system. The initrd contains a minimal set of directories and executables to achieve this, such
#as the insmod tool to install kernel modules into the kernel.
#In the case of desktop or server Linux systems, the initrd is a transient file system. Its lifetime is short, only serving as a
#bridge to the real root file system. In embedded systems with no mutable storage, the initrd is the permanent root file system.
